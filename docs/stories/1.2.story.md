# Story 1.2: Docker Deployment Implementation

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to containerize the Telegram listener application for Docker deployment on my VPS with Portainer,
**so that** I can deploy and manage the application in a consistent, scalable container environment without vendor lock-in.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Create a `Dockerfile` that builds a Python-based container image with all dependencies ‚úÖ
2. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file for complete deployment orchestration ‚úÖ  
3. Implement Docker volume mounting for persistent session file storage ‚úÖ
4. Configure environment variable handling for containerized deployment ‚úÖ
5. Update the application to support session file storage in `/app/data` volume ‚úÖ
6. Create deployment documentation for both Portainer UI and command-line deployment ‚úÖ
7. Remove Render.com deployment configuration files (render.yaml) ‚úÖ
8. Test local Docker deployment to ensure functionality ‚ö†Ô∏è (Ready for user testing)
9. Provide Portainer-specific deployment instructions for VPS deployment ‚úÖ

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1: Complete basic project structure is in place with main.py, requirements.txt, and all core application files. Need to adapt for containerized deployment while maintaining existing functionality.

### Data Models
**TelegramMessage** - Same as Story 1.1, no changes needed [Source: architecture.md#Data Models]
- Container deployment doesn't affect message structure
- JSON serialization remains unchanged for webhook delivery

### API Specifications
**n8n Webhook Integration** - Same as Story 1.1 [Source: architecture.md#n8n Webhook API]
- Container networking allows outbound HTTP requests
- No API changes needed for containerized deployment

### Component Specifications
**Docker Container** - New containerization layer [Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack]
- **Base Image**: python:3.9-slim for minimal footprint
- **Working Directory**: /app for application files
- **Volume Mount**: /app/data for persistent session storage
- **Network**: Bridge network for container isolation
- **Restart Policy**: unless-stopped for production reliability

**Container Management** - Portainer integration [Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack]
- **Technology**: Portainer Latest for web-based Docker management
- **Deployment**: Manual deployment via Portainer UI
- **Configuration**: Environment variables via Portainer interface
- **Monitoring**: Container logs available through Portainer

**Data Persistence** - Docker volume storage [Source: architecture.md#Architectural Patterns]
- **Session File**: Moved from root directory to /app/data/session.session
- **Volume Type**: Named Docker volume for persistence across container lifecycle
- **Backup**: Volume data persists independently of container updates

### File Locations
Updated project structure for Docker deployment [Source: architecture.md#Unified Project Structure]:
```
telegram-n8n-integration/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile                 # New: Container build configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml         # New: Deployment orchestration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py                   # Updated: Session path to /app/data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ discover_chats.py         # Updated: Session path to /app/data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt          # Unchanged: Python dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env.example             # Unchanged: Environment template  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore               # Updated: Docker-specific ignores
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data/                    # New: Volume mount point
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ session.session      # Persistent session storage
```

### Testing Requirements
**Container Testing Strategy** [Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack]
- Local Docker build validation using `docker build`
- Local deployment testing using `docker-compose up`
- Session persistence testing with container restart
- Environment variable validation in container context
- Application functionality testing in containerized environment

### Technical Constraints
**Docker Requirements** [Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack]
- **Container Runtime**: Docker latest with docker-compose support
- **Base Image**: python:3.9-slim for consistency with current Python version
- **Volume Persistence**: Named volumes for session file storage
- **Environment Variables**: Container-native configuration management
- **Networking**: Bridge networking for container isolation

**VPS Deployment Constraints**
- **Portainer Management**: Web-based deployment and monitoring
- **Manual Deployment**: No automatic CI/CD pipeline
- **Resource Management**: Self-managed VPS resources
- **Security**: Container-level isolation and environment variable security

## Testing
**Docker Testing Standards**:
1. **Build Testing**: Verify Dockerfile builds successfully without errors
2. **Deployment Testing**: Validate docker-compose deployment works locally
3. **Persistence Testing**: Confirm session file persists across container restarts
4. **Environment Testing**: Verify all environment variables load correctly in container
5. **Functionality Testing**: Ensure Telegram integration works in containerized environment
